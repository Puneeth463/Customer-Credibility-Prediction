# Loan-Classification
This is Customer Credibility Prediction web app project with deployment using streamlit on Heroku.

Steps involved in Project

1. As a initial step imported a Dataset from "Kaggle" an internet open source community
2. Loaded both train.csv and test.csv
3. Performed Data Cleaning and Cleaned datasets where named as clean_train.csv and clean_test.csv
4. Model Building using Logistic Regression classifier algorithm as Model Building.ipynb file
5. And built Model.pkl file using pickle library
6. loaded the pickle file into app1.py using streamlit framework
7. the final output can be viewed as by running it ...run the program by using command streamlit run app.py
8. Finally deploy the model in heroku platform
